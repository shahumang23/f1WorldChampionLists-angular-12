# Presentation Of The F1 world champions List .

## Requirements

We will use http://ergast.com/mrd/ to create a single page application that
presents a list that shows the F1 world champions starting from 2005 until
now. Clicking on an item shows the list of the winners for every race for the
selected year. We also request to highlight the row when the winner has
been the world champion in the same season.


## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply unzip the `f1WorldChampionLists-angular-12` folder and install the dependencies:

### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and Angular framework code. The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the Node package manager.

```
npm install
```

After that, you should find out that you have
below new folders in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need

### Run the Application

We have pre configured the project with a simple development web server. The simplest way to start
this server is:

```
ng serve
```

Now browse to the app at [`http://localhost:4200/`].

### Running Unit Tests

The f1WorldChampionLists-angular-12 app comes some pre configured with unit tests. These are written in Jasmine, which we run with the Karma test runner.

```
ng test
```
